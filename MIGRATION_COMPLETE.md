2. Ensure the API key is valid (test with `bun run test:gemini`)
3. Restart your server after updating the environment

### If AI Features Don't Work

1. Check server logs for Gemini-related errors
2. Verify API key permissions in Google Cloud Console
3. Check if safety filters are blocking content
4. Monitor API quotas and usage limits
