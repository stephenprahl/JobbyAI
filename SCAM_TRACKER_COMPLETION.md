# Job Scam Tracker - Implementation Complete! 🛡️

## ✅ What Has Been Built

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)

- **JobScam Model**: Stores scam reports with fields for title, company, description, scam type, severity, status, evidence URLs, etc.
- **UserScamWarning Model**: Tracks when users have been warned about specific scams
- **Enums**: ScamSeverity (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL), ScamStatus (REPORTED, VERIFIED, DISMISSED, UNDER_REVIEW)

### 2. Backend API Routes (`/api/scams`)

- **GET `/`**: Paginated list of all scam reports with filtering by status, severity, scam type
- **POST `/report`**: Submit new scam reports with validation and duplicate checking
- **POST `/check`**: Check if a job posting might be a scam (risk assessment)
- **GET `/stats`**: Dashboard statistics (total reports, verified scams, recent reports, etc.)
- **PUT `/:scamId/verify`**: Admin-only endpoint to verify scam reports
- **GET `/my-warnings`**: Get user's scam warnings

### 3. Frontend React Component (`ScamTrackerPage`)

- **Dashboard**: Statistics cards showing total reports, verified scams, recent activity
- **Filtering System**: Filter by status, severity, scam type, and search functionality
- **Scam List**: Paginated display of all scam reports with details
- **Report Modal**: Form to submit new scam reports with validation
- **Details Modal**: View complete information about any scam report

## 🔒 Security Features

### User Protection

- **Warning System**: Users are automatically warned when they encounter similar scams
- **Community Protection**: Every report helps protect other users

### Data Validation

- Required fields validation on both frontend and backend
- Duplicate report detection to prevent spam
- Authentication required for all operations
- Admin-only verification system

## 📊 Database Design

### Key Tables

```sql
JobScam {
  id, reportedById, title, companyName, location, description,
  url, email, phone, salary, employmentType, scamType,
  severity, status, evidenceUrls, notes, warningCount,
  verifiedAt, verifiedById, createdAt, updatedAt
}

UserScamWarning {
  id, userId, scamId, warnedAt, dismissed
}
```

### Relationships

- JobScam belongs to User (reportedBy)
- JobScam optionally belongs to User (verifiedBy)
- UserScamWarning connects Users to JobScams they've been warned about

## 🎯 API Integration Ready

The system is designed to integrate with job search functionality:

```typescript
// Example: Check if a job posting is potentially a scam
const checkJobSafety = async (jobData) => {
  const response = await api.post('/api/scams/check', {
    title: jobData.title,
    companyName: jobData.company,
    url: jobData.url,
    email: jobData.email
  });

  if (response.data.data.riskLevel === 'HIGH') {
    // Show warning to user
    showScamWarning(response.data.data.warnings);
  }
};
```
