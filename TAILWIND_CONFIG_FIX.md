# Tailwind Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolved ✅

Fixed the Tailwind CSS performance warning that was appearing during development:

```
warn - Your `content` configuration includes a pattern which looks like it's accidentally matching all of `node_modules` and can cause serious performance issues.
warn - Pattern: `./extension/**/*.ts`
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `tailwind.config.js`

**Before:**

```javascript
content: [
  "./index.html",
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./extension/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,html}",  // This was too broad
],
```

**After:**

```javascript
content: [
  "./index.html",
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  "./extension/popup/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,html}",     // More specific
  "./extension/content/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",        // More specific
  "./extension/background/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",     // More specific
],
```

### 2. Updated `.env` CORS Configuration

**Before:**

```
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

**After:**

```
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5174
```

## Result

- ✅ **No more Tailwind warnings** during development
- ✅ **Better performance** by avoiding scanning `node_modules`
- ✅ **More specific content patterns** that only match actual source files
- ✅ **Correct CORS configuration** matching the actual client port
- ✅ **Development server running smoothly** on both client and server

## Current Status

- **Client**: <http://localhost:5174/> (Vite development server)
- **Server**: <http://localhost:3001> (Elysia API server)
- **Application**: Fully functional with Tailwind CSS styling
- **Performance**: Optimized Tailwind build process

The Tailwind CSS migration is now running without any warnings or configuration issues.
